## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Python 3.8+ (for the Discover feature backend)
- Foursquare API key (for the Discover feature)

### Frontend Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd truffle-shuffle
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:5173`)

### Backend Installation (Optional - for Discover Feature)

The Discover feature requires a Python backend to connect to the Foursquare API.

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up your Foursquare API credentials:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Get your credentials from [Foursquare Developers](https://foursquare.com/developers/apps)
   - Add your client ID and secret to the `.env` file:
     ```
     FOURSQUARE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
     FOURSQUARE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
     ```

5. Start the backend server:
```bash
python app.py
```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:5001`

> **Note**: The frontend will work without the backend, but the Discover feature will show an error message if the backend is not running.
